            <h2 class="p_detail">My portfolio showcases a range of projects that blend creativity and technical skills across multiple
                programming languages and platforms. From building an AI voice assistant and a face recognition
                attendance system in Python to crafting interactive web applications in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, these
                projects demonstrate my commitment to both innovation and functionality. Each project has been a
                stepping stone in my journey to develop solutions that are not only technically sound but also enhance
                user experience through intuitive design and responsive interactions.</h2>
