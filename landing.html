          <p class="bi">Hello! I'm Aman, a first-year B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student at Amity University Jharkhand. I
            have a keen interest in programming and have worked on several projects, including a Jarvis AI with voice
            assistance and a face recognition attendance system in Python. I also enjoy building small web projects
            using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, such as games and utilities like calculators and currency converters.
            Currently, I'm developing my portfolio website, which will feature 3D animations and a responsive design to
            showcase my work.</p>
